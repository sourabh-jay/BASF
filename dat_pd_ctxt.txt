The objective ofthese studies is to minimize the risk to humans, animals and the environment. Animal studies are centrallymonitored by BASF SE to guarantee that the studies commissioned by BASF worldwide are carried out inaccordance with the same ethical aspects and animal welfare considerations as those performed within BASF.BASF™s company policy is to eliminate all unnecessary animal testing and to support the development ofalternative test methods that involve in vitro testing or that require the minimum possible number of animals.However, alternative test methods are not available for all toxicological end points, and the validation of suchtest methods again requires the use of animals.The product is used in chemical and technical applications.The product has not been tested on animals by BASF.;Is PRD 30478270 tested on animals;The product has not been tested on animals;1482;RheovisFRCAnimalTesting3
